# Logistic-Regression

**Introduction**


Hi everyone, Today we are going to see Logistic Regression from the scratch. In Machine Learning techniques Logistic Regression has separate strong importance. Logistic Regression is used to solve classification problems. The classification algorithm Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical. The dependant variable in logistic regression is a binary variable with data coded as 1 (yes, happy, True, normal, success, etc.) or 0 (no, Sad, False, abnormal, failure, etc.). In this blog, we are going to explore logistic regression to predict whether a user can buy a car or not.

**Theory**


We know the logistic regression algorithm used to solve classification problems. Instead of fitting a straight line or hyperplane, the logistic regression model uses the logistic function to squeeze the output of a linear equation between 0 and 1. The logistic function is defined as:
